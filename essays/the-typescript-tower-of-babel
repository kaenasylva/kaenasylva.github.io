### About TypeScript as a Beginner
Okay, so the title might be a little misleading. As a former Java and C++ programmer, the syntax of TypeScript shares a lot of similarities with what I’m familiar with. I really appreciate NOT having to type out as much as I was required to when I was learning/implementing code in Java. What I found the strangest while learning TypeScript is that it just assumes what type your variables are. Therefore, while you should declare what type your variables are (for safety reasons), you don’t actually have to (but still, you should).

### Regarding TypeScript as a Software Engineering Language
As far as a programming language for software engineers, I think it’s a great language to learn and use. In my one week of experience thus far, the language seems very simple, in a C++ kind of way, where a lot of stuff can be done with a relatively little amount of code. It also helps that TypeScript can do things like assume variable types as a sort of handhold while you develop.

### A New Way to Learn
I am currently enrolled in ICS 314, and in it, we’re applying a learning process called athletic software engineering. In practice, you engage in timed activities called WODs (Workout of the Day) where a problem is presented and you solve it on the spot, within an allotted time.  I have found this style of learning to be slightly stressful, since it’s one thing to spend a few hours solving a problem, and it’s another to have to do it in one sitting. I will say, it feels like a very practical skill to have, and it targets your actual understanding of the content you’re engaging with. For example, you can use the internet to find answers, but the WOD itself becomes a lot harder (and takes much longer) when you have to learn AND implement code on the spot. So far, I’ve done two practice WODs in preparation for the real thing, and I can say confidently that, so far, it is a learning process that will work for and benefit me in the long run.
