## Overview
### The Problem
Students at UH Mﾄ］oa often find it difficult to stay updated on campus events, activities, and workshops that align with their academic interests or social preferences. Despite the availability of various events (e.g., club meetings, guest lectures, career fairs, etc.), students often miss them due to a lack of centralized information. Additionally, discovering events that match personal preferences (like specific academic fields, hobbies, or social causes) is time-consuming and inefficient.

### The Solution
The **Mﾄ］oa Events Finder** web application aggregates all campus events into a single platform. The app will allow users to register, set up profiles, and get personalized event recommendations based on their interests, academic schedules, and social preferences.

The app will allow students to:
- View a list of upcoming events
- Get personalized recommendations based on their profile
- Filter events by category (academic, social, career-oriented, etc.)
- Add events to their calendar or set reminders
- Share events with friends and receive recommendations based on mutual interests

## Mockup Page Ideas
1. **Home Dashboard**
    - The landing page where students can see a personalized feed of upcoming events. The feed will be dynamically generated based on the student's profile preferences and interests. The homepage will also include filters like "Today's Events," "This Week," and "Nearby Events."
2. **Event Details Page**
    - A detailed page for each event where students can see the full description, event schedule, location, and the option to add it to their personal calendar. There will also be a "Share" button for easy social media or direct sharing with friends.
3. **Profile & Interest Settings**
    - A profile page where students can set their academic interests, hobbies, and social activities preferences. They can also link their academic schedule to get event suggestions that fit between classes or free periods.
4. **Search & Filter Page**
    - A search page where users can filter events by type (e.g., "Academic," "Career Development," "Social," "Sports," etc.), date, or keyword. The page will show relevant events that match the user's criteria.

## Use Case Ideas
Here are some examples of users experiencing the app...

- *Freshman Looking for Academic Events*: A first-year student registers on Mﾄ］oa Events Finder and selects academic events, career fairs, and research seminars as their interests. The app suggests upcoming academic talks and research group meetings based on their profile that the student can add to their calendar.
- *Student Seeking Campus Meetups*: An upperclassman wants to meet new people. They set their profile to show social events like parties, club meetups, and student group activities. The app suggests several club meetups later in the week that the upperclassman can attend.
- *Busy Student Maximizing Time Between Classes*: A student with a 30-minute gap between classes gets recommendations from Mﾄ］oa Events Finder for activities that are nearby and fit their schedule, like a career workshop happening in the same building as an upcoming class.
