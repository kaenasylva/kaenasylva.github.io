The Computer Science chapter in the Annals of My Life begins in my early childhood. The first games I ever played were Halo: Reach and Minecraft on the Xbox 360. As my interest in gaming expanded its horizons, I began engaging with PC gaming. By my junior year of high school, I had built my first computer. If you’ve never worked with hardware like that before, let me tell you, it makes you feel smart. I felt like I could do anything. So, that same year, I took my first computer programming course. It was a 101 that was taught in C++.

I excelled in that class to the point that, within a few weeks, I was helping classmates debug and complete their codes. It was at this point that I decided I would be going to college for computer science. I enrolled at the University of Hawaii, with my end goal being a B.S. in Information & Computer Science. I have since taken several ICS-related courses and learned a handful of programming languages. Currently, I am learning Software Engineering and taking the first real steps towards a professional career in CS.

So, here we are. It feels like just yesterday I learned to tread water, and now I’m freestyling toward the finish line at the end of the pool. I hope that I might emerge victorious at the end of this race with practical programming skills that I can apply in the real world, in a professional setting. I want to continue to practice applying my knowledge toward creating things that I am proud of so that I can share them with the world.
